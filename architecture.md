I want to develop a web application that allows users to chat with openai models.

I want to use the following technologies:
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- MUI
- Cerebras Inference
- Cerebras Cloud SDK
- Email and Password Login
- Google Login
- NextAuth
- Magic Link should be sent to the user's email after signup.
- Users need to input invite code to register after signup using email or google.
